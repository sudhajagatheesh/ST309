## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure,echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Setting up
Remove all the objects in the environment
read the data
skip, the number of lines of the data file to skip before beginning to read data.
row.names: giving the column of the table which contains the row names, 
```{r}
rm(list = ls())
forbes2000 = read.csv("Forbes2000.csv", row.names = 1,skip=3)
head(forbes2000)
```

# (a)
Find the top 10 ranked companies, the companies with the 10 maximum sales, and the companies
with the market value greater than 174 billion USD
```{r}
attach(forbes2000)
name[rank <= 10]
```

```{r}
name[marketvalue >= 174]
```

```{r}
name[sales > sort(sales,decreasing = TRUE)[10]]
```

# (b)
Plot the histograms for marketvalue and log(marketvalue)
```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
hist(marketvalue,main='histogram of market values',col=1)
hist(log(marketvalue),main='histogram of log market values',col=2)
```

# (c)
Compare the outcomes from mean(profits) and mean(profits, na.rm=T)
```{r}
mean(profits)
mean(profits,na.rm = TRUE)
```

# (d)
Median profit for the companies in US and UK separately
```{r}
median(profits[country=='United States'],na.rm = TRUE)
```
```{r}
median(profits[country=='United Kingdom'],na.rm=TRUE)
```

# (e)
Find all German companies with negative profit
```{r}
name[country == 'Germany'& profits < 0]
```

# (f)
To which business category do most of the Bermuda island companies belong
```{r}
table(category[country =='Bermuda'])
```

# (g) 
For the 50 companies with the highest profits, plot profits against assets, using some suitable transformation for each variable if appropriate.
```{r}
profits_sort <- sort(profits,decreasing = TRUE)[1:50]
asset_sort <- assets[profits >= profits_sort[50] & !is.na(profits)]
```

cex the size of point
cex.lab the size of label
pch the style of points
```{r}
plot(log(asset_sort),log(profits_sort),
     xlab='log Assets',ylab = 'log profits',
     cex.lab=1.5,pch=20)
```

remember to detach when you finish analysis with the data set
```{r}
detach()
```
